BraindumpSnippetManager
=======================

Braindump Snippet Manager is a WPF application originally created by Nayden Gochev, who discontinued working on it. The application is perfect for developer coding presentations. I added some useful features and increased stability. Feel free to join and improve it :)

Features:
- Insert a code snippet from the clipboard into program
- Delete code snippets
- Preview of a code snippet when you mouse over 
- Backup your code snippets into a file
- Load your code snippets from a file
- Create a separator for the code snippets that basically marks a start for a new demo.
- Act as Clipboard Manager. Giving you the ability to use it as a clipboard manager for text only.
- Move snippet up/down
- Presenting mode to dock it to the left side and only show the numbers
